EIP 575 over GPIB

The EIP 575 uses older style 2516 and 2532 EPROMs. My EPROM reader was unable to
read the 2532s because the pins are not compatible with the more modern 2732 EPROM.

However there is a Test Command accessible by GPIB that allows you to read / write
arbitrary memory locations.

I poked around the memory map looking for the chunks that seemed to match the EPROM 
575 revision D images that I had downloaded.

Once I identified where they were most probably located, I implemented this to 
read and extract the EPROM data into IntelHex files. These were then diffed against
the existing ones and are identical.

This means that my device should be able to be updated to implement the power meter
Option 2, although the calibration constants are not likely to be correct. I believe
that these reside on the EPROM that is fitted to the A107 Gate 

WARNING: this is a slow process. It took about 45 minutes to dump all the data.
